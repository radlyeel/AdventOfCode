This project picks up "in the middle" of Advent of Code 2020, specifically
on Day 3: Toboggan Tragectory.  For unknown reasons, previous work on this
has been lost.  I pick up from here using Python 3, as that is the most
important skill for me to develop at this point.

Starting with Day 9, I will keep the two "parts" separate so that, for
example, Day 9 consists of day09p1.py and day09p2.py.  This will allow
running Part 1 programs later without having to checkout the particular
version of interest.
